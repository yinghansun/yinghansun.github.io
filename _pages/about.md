<!-- About Me
------ -->
I am a master student at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), advised by [Dr. Wei Zhang](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhangwei-2.html) and [Dr. Hua Chen](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/chenhua.html). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree in Robotics Engineering in 2021 from SUSTech. Currently, my research interests lie in perceptive locomotion of legged robot and deep reinforcement learning.

- **Teaching assistant** in ME424 Modern Control and Estimation, SUSTech.      
    <small>[[course website]](https://www.wzhanglab.site/teaching/moderncontrolestimation/) [[recordings (Youtube)]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tt-SPHPAMM&list=PLYkCanigA7S4N4FAXu4ABmwuC7yHDL6_v&index=1) [[recordings (Bilibili)]](https://space.bilibili.com/474380277/channel/seriesdetail?sid=291615)</small>  
    <small>*Course introduction*: This course will introduce the students to the fundamental concepts and methods in modern control and estimation theory. Topics include state-space modeling of dynamical systems, least-square estimation and system identification, state-feedback and output-feedback controller design, observer design, linear quadratic regulators, and Kalman filter. The course will also connect these control and estimation methods to applications in robotics, mechanical, electrical, and aerospace systems.</small>
